# Container Orchestration
- When we consider enterprise applications, we see that there are multiple containers that need to be managed
- When we want to run containers in a multi-host environment, the following challenges arise:
    1. Managing multiple hosts and clusters
    2. Running containers on specifi hosts
    3. Communication between containers on multiple hosts or data centers
    4. Accessing storage which is present in another data center
    5. Name resolution of containers running separately
- To solve the above management problem of containers, we use <b>container orchestration</b> tools
- Container orchestration is a collective name for a set of services for container scheduling and cluster management
- Some popular tools for this are Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos marathon, Nomad and Amazon ECS
